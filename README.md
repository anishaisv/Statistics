# 📊 Statistics Primer: Descriptive, Inferential & Hypothesis Testing

Welcome to the **Statistics Primer** repository! This project offers a foundational overview of three key areas in statistics:

- **Descriptive Statistics**
- **Inferential Statistics**
- **Hypothesis Testing**
---

## 📌 1. Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics help **summarize and describe** the main features of a dataset.

### Key Concepts:
- **Measures of Central Tendency**:
  - Mean (average)
  - Median (middle value)
  - Mode (most frequent value)

- **Measures of Dispersion**:
  - Range
  - Variance
  - Standard Deviation
  - Interquartile Range (IQR)

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Histograms
  - Box plots
  - Bar charts
  - Pie charts

📦 *Use case:* Understand the overall pattern, spread, and shape of the data before applying advanced analysis.

## 📌 2. Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics allow us to **make predictions or generalizations** about a population based on a sample.

### Key Concepts:
- **Population vs. Sample**
- **Sampling Methods**
- **Estimation**:
  - Point Estimation
  - Confidence Intervals

- **Probability Distributions**:
  - Normal Distribution
  - Binomial Distribution
  - t-distribution

📦 *Use case:* Drawing conclusions about a larger group without having to survey every member.

## 📌 3. Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to **test assumptions** (hypotheses) about a population parameter.

### Key Concepts:
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: No effect or difference
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Presence of effect or difference
- **p-value**: Probability of observing the result if H₀ is true
- **Significance Level (α)**: Typically 0.05
- **Type I and Type II Errors**

### Common Tests:
- **Z-test / t-test**: Compare means
- **Chi-square test**: Compare categorical variables
- **ANOVA**: Compare more than two groups
- **Correlation & Regression**: Explore relationships between variables
